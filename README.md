# Artificial Neural Network for Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for solving regression problems. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning to predict continuous target variables based on input features.

## Features
- **Customizable Architecture**: Easily modify the layers and neurons for different regression tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature normalization/scaling for optimal ANN performance.
- **Model Training**: Implements training with backpropagation and optimization using a specified loss function.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Displays training loss curves and prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ANN_for_regression.git
   cd ANN_for_regression
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `ANN_for_regression.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your dataset, configure the ANN, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
